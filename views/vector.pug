              h2.left What is Vector Conversion?
              | Vector conversion is when a raster file is modified or redrawn
              | into a vector format. A raster image can be redrawn in two ways:

                h3 Using Simplified Vectors
                | When an image is converted into vector, the resultant image
                | will be a simplified version of the original one. Simple
                | vectorized images are suitable for all processes including
                | those that require “True Vector”.

                h3 Using Vectors &amp; Gradients
                | An image created using vectors and gradients may look slightly
                | different than the original one, but it may not be suitable
                | for all processes that require 100% vector.

                  h3 Scalability and Performance
                  | Vector images are best used for logos and illustrations,
                  | technical drawings and other processes that need specialty
                  | signs and printing, engraving and etching. The best thing
                  | about vector image is that a multi-color vector can easily be
                  | converted into a single-color image. Limited colors are often
                  | required in the promotional industry to print logos on items
                  | such as pens, cups, bottles, etc.

                  h3 Changing an Image from CMYK to Spot Color
                  | Since most raster images can only be printed in CMYK (or
                  | 4-color process), the colors in your design may not print
                  | exactly as expected. CMYK refers to the four colors of inks
                  | used in commercial printing: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
                  | CMYK prints use a blend of these four colors to create a full
                  | color image result.

                  | Spot colors are pre-mixed inks that are applied only to the
                  | area assigned for each particular color. This ensures complete
                  | control over the tones of the colors in the final printed
                  | design. If the colors in your design need to be an exact match
                  | to a pre-selected tone, we can convert your raster images to
                  | vector graphics with spot colors.

              h3 Raster Images
              | Raster and Vector are two types of file formats, which have
              | different applications in the world of design. Raster images,
              | often called as bitmap images are made of millions of tiny
              | squares, called pixels. When you zoom a raster image, you will
              | clearly see the square outlines of each pixel. The images
              | captured using a camera or scanner are raster images. Examples
              | of raster files include - jpeg, gif, png etc. Raster image like
              | a photograph holds a lot of details and are versatile in
              | designs. However, it becomes pixelated and loses resolution when
              | zoomed. These files are acceptable for digital publication and
              | print medium such as books, magazines, and newspapers. Raster
              | images should be saved in a high DPI setting before using them
              | on the print medium.

              h3 Vector Images
              | A vector image is composed of lines (paths) and shapes which are
              | digitally composed using mathematical calculations. Such images
              | are created by combining tiles of different shapes and sizes.
              | These shapes are called objects, which display one single color
              | each. If you zoom in on a vector image, it won&apos;t get blurry or
              | pixelated and maintains consistent image quality. A vector image
              | can be scaled to any size or resolution and is easy to transmit
              | over the Internet. Vector graphic can be created with
              | Illustration software such as Illustrator, CorelDraw, Inkscape,
              | and more.
